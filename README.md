Stuff I did on Replit

> [!NOTE]
> Some of the projects are in Romainian (I will not update them for English)

<sub> i am uploading everything here since replit has started limiting repls to jut ***3*** in a single account and even though they haven't started deleting what i've done i'm quite scared. therefore it's better to keep them on github </sub>
